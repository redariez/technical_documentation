        <p> We’ve all seen the likes of Frank Medrano on YouTube (if you haven’t – check him out!), been amazed, inspired and motivated to start calisthenics but the journey often stops at the first hurdle. How do I even start calisthenics? Is it just a case of doing more push ups, pull ups and planks? How will I ever get from a push up to handstands and even the frog to handstand?
          <code> push()</code></p>

        <p>These are questions we often get asked and even asked ourselves before the birth of the School of Calisthenics. If you’re asking those questions and want to get over that first hurdle of where to start calisthenics, then stick with us.We’ve walked that path. We’ve made all the mistakes at the start of our calisthenics journey. The good news is that we’ve managed to redefine what’s impossible along the way! If you want to start, we’d love to give you some extra help with our FREE Beginners Programme inside the Virtual Classroom, which includes video coaching tutorials, weekly programmes, fun challenges and advice to help you start calisthenics today. You should also keep 5 things in mind.
        </p>
        <li>Make sure to always properly warm up</li>
        <li>Always incorporate full range of motion</li>
        <li>Hydrate properly before and during your training</li>
        <li>Take time to plan and track yourr training</li>
        <li>Incorporate progressive overload to reach new heights</li>

          Traditional strength training often goes out of the window when training an athlete that may be missing multiple limbs, for example, and you have to really understand how the body works in order to get the training effect you desire as a coach.<code> push()</code<br>
            At the start of your journey you’ll notice your rate of progression is huge and this can be very addictive. You’re exposing your body and brain to a very new training environment and stimulation and you’re learning new things. It can be very easy at this point to get excited and start trying to run before we can walk… which is a trap many of us fall into (including myself).
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Earning the right to progress’ means we must build the foundation first, play the long game as this will not only reduce risk of injury but will ensure you’re progression continues long after the ‘introductory’ phase.

          Remember the house built on solid foundations? Build a house that will last!

          This is such and important point in calisthenics and something that translates into the bigger picture of life, if you get it right!<code> push()</code<br>

            Everyone starts their Calisthenics journey at different points. Previous training history, age, past injuries etc all dictate you’re starting point. No one is the same as you, you are unique and your journey starts with you. Seeing others and how good they are or how they’ve progressed should be used as inspiration and motivation rather than a comparison.

            It’s easier said than done. I’ve falling into this trap countless times and it can be very de-motivating and even upsetting. Remember you’re trying to be the best version of yourself and as long as you’re improving and being better than your were ‘yesterday’ then you’re moving forward, and that’s what matters!

          Yes people who are great at calisthenics are strong and you may often feel that you’re just not strong enough. This may be the case but remember calisthenics is more than just strength.<br>

          Calisthenics comes from the Greek words ‘kalos’ and ‘sthenos’ means beauty and strength. Beauty requires movement, meaning good controlled range of motion at our joints. Ever see someone with tight hamstrings try and touch their toes? It’s not pretty is it! Or maybe you know how that feels?<code> push()</code Not only do we require good range of motion and therefore mobility and flexibility about our joints for Calisthenics, it’s actually essential for the strength aspect of Calisthenics. If you’re lacking range of motion at the shoulder and effected by poor posture then you’ll have trouble getting into some of the required position in calisthenics, particularly overhead positions like in Handstands and Human Flags for example. </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The brain is clever. If the joint is restricted and a position feels very awkward, the brain won’t allow you to use all the strength of the muscles surrounding that joint. It’s worried you’ll injury yourself and the brain doesn’t want that. It likes to protect as an ingrained survival mechanism. So even if the muscles around the shoulder are very strong, if you’re inherently tight in overhead positions, for example, the brain won’t let you use that strength.

            Therefore working on your mobility and range of motion will not only help you create nicer looking (more beautiful) shapes your brain will also allow you to use all of the strength you have rather than restricting your strength capacity in order to protect itself!

          This is an area of huge frustration for us as Strength & Conditioning coaches and something that we get asked about all the time. You don’t need to lift weights to build muscle. Loading the muscular system with resistance via bodyweight or external weights can both force the body to adapt and eventually grow. Your body doesn’t care, or even know for that matter, where the resistance the muscles are experience is coming from. You can use metal weights, rubber weights, resistance bands, bodyweight exercises, lifting hey bales… it’s all the same to the body!<code> push()</code It’s like the old joke of ‘how much does a 10kg box of feathers weigh?’ So stop worrying that you can’t build muscle or get a good training session done without lifting weights. It will change your life! Using your own bodyweight as the resistance opens up so much more freedom for your training! </p>

          When you start developing your calisthenics you’ll want to move past the basics of push ups, pull ups and dips. As you start to advance you’ll be using variations of those basics that requires more joint ranges of motion and ultimately loading your connective tissue (tendons and ligaments etc) more than traditional weight training as you use more isometric (static) hold in Calisthenics. You’re connective tissue doesn’t get the same blood flow as your muscle do and therefore take longer to adapt to the training. It’s therefore important you look after your joints, especially the wrist, elbows and shoulders as its likely that you’ll be asking a little more of them than with your standard workout.

          Body alignment is such an important aspect of calisthenics as we are no longer sitting in machines or lying supported on benches as you might have worked out traditionally. We have to support our own bodyweight at all times and this is one of the great benefits to calisthenics. Whether you like it or not your core has to be working in every exercise, when you focus on your body alignment.
